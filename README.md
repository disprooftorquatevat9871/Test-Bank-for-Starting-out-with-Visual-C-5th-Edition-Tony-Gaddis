  * Starting Out With Visual C# is an ideal introductory Visual C# text for students with no prior programming experience. Students who are new to programming will appreciate the clear, down-to-earth explanations and the detailed walk-throughs that are provided by the hands-on tutorials. Gaddis’s hallmark, step-by-step instructions are supported by a GUI-based approach that motivates students as they learn to create GUI-based, event-driven, Visual C# applications. Topics are examined progressively in each chapter, with objects taught before classes. The 5th Edition adds an abundance of new material and improvements with updates for compatibility with Visual Studio 2017. Two new chapters include Chapter 13: Delegates and Lambda Expressions and Chapter 14: Language-Integrated Query (LINQ).
